## Urls

Use absolute urls for SEO when adding new urls. 

Be aware when adding a new url that they will pull from the filesystem
hosted on Github.  This means that if you make a new
style change in a local css file, this will not be reflected when
running the generated site locally until you push the
style sheet to the remote repo.
