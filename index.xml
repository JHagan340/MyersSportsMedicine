      <description>Adhesive capsulitis is when a person loses the ability to move their shoulder around in all directions without pain. This problem is commonly referred to as a frozen shoulder, as the shoulder usually becomes stiff and will be hard to move at all. The causes of ashesive capsulitis are somewhat unknown and tend to happen randomly.

      <description>A SLAP tear, also known as a superior labral tear, is when part of the shoulder joint known as the labrum is torn. The shoulder is similar to the hip as they are both ball and socket joints, but the shoulder joint is very shallow, so it is unstable. The labrum helps make the shoulder more stable by forming a cup that the end of the humerus can move around in.</description>

      <description>The shoulder joint is similar to the hip as they are both ball and socket joints. The shoulder joint’s socket is very shallow though, which inherently makes the shoulder joint unstable. This means that extra support in the shoulder is needed as the shoulder bones aren’t held in place adequately.shoulder-labrum-tear
The labrum is what compensates for the shallow socket the shoulder joint has. The labrum is a cuff of cartilage that forms a cup for the end of the arm bone (the humerus) to move around in.</description>

      <guid>https://grantcooksey.github.io/MyersSportsMedicine/the-shoulder/frozen-shoulder-symptoms/</guid>
      <description>A frozen shoulder causes symptoms easily recognizable by a doctor. The most noticeable symptom is restricted movement in the shoulder. It is possible for other conditions to have similar symptoms as a frozen shoulder, such as a rotator cuff tear, so always have your medical problem diagnosed properly by a doctor. There are different causes of frozen shoulders.
Common frozen shoulder symptoms:  Limited and restricted movement of the shoulder Shoulder pain.</description>

      <guid>https://grantcooksey.github.io/MyersSportsMedicine/the-shoulder/frozen-shoulder/</guid>
      <description>A frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is when motion of the shoulder joint is restricted. The cause of frozen shoulders isn’t well understood, and it usually happens randomly for no known reason. A frozen will cause the capsule around the shoulder joint to contract, which forms scar tissue.
Causes of a Frozen Shoulder Generally, a frozen shoulder will occur without an associated injury or cause. It’s possible for a patient to develop a frozen shoulder after some sort of injury, but that is usually not the case.</description>

      <title>Symptoms of a Dislocated Shoulder</title>
      <link>https://grantcooksey.github.io/MyersSportsMedicine/the-shoulder/symptoms-of-a-dislocated-shoulder/</link>

      <guid>https://grantcooksey.github.io/MyersSportsMedicine/the-shoulder/symptoms-of-a-dislocated-shoulder/</guid>
      <description>Shoulder dislocation is a common injury that usually results from a wide variety of sports. Generally when a shoulder is dislocated, the head of the humerus (the upper arm bone) is forced forwards when the arm is turned outwards and being held out to the side. This dislocation, known as an anterior dislocation, makes up approximately 95% of all shoulder dislocations.
The other 5% of dislocations, posterior dislocations, inferior dislocations, superior dislocations, or intra thoracic dislocations, are rarer.</description>

      <guid>https://grantcooksey.github.io/MyersSportsMedicine/the-shoulder/symptoms-of-a-rotator-cuff-tear/</guid>
      <description>The rotator cuff is a group of muscles which work together and are responsible for the shoulder (Glenohumeral) joint’s stability while it moves and rotates. The rotator cuff muscles include Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Minor, and the Subscapularis.
The Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus are the most commonly injured rotator cuff muscles. These injuries are usually related to sports involved with a lot of shoulder rotation, such as swimming, pitching a baseball, or bowling.</description>

      <description>The anterior cruciate ligament, also known as the ACL, is one of the major cruciate ligaments that are located within the joints of the knee. The ACL provides stability to your knees, along with preventing over-bending and over-straightening of the knee. The ligament is connected between the tibia and femur. A torn ACL can refer to any injury caused to the ligament. A number of different things can cause a town ACL, such as a twisting force applied to the knee while the foot is firmly placed on the ground, or a direct blow to the knee upon a landing.</description>

      <title>Meniscus Tears</title>

      <guid>https://grantcooksey.github.io/MyersSportsMedicine/the-knee/meniscus-tears/</guid>
      <description>The meniscus is a small, “c” shaped piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion for the knee joint. They sit between the shin bone (tibia) and the thigh bone (femur), with one being on the outside and one being on the inside of the knee.
What Is a Meniscus Tear? A meniscus tear usually occurs during movements that forcefully rotate the knee while the knee is bearing weight, which results in the piece of cartilage being torn.</description>

      <description>##What is articular cartilage?
Articular cartilage, also known as hyaline cartilage, is a very smooth yet hard material made up of the protein collagen. The cartilage is located on a bone’s articulating surfaces (surfaces of a bone that come in contact with other bones). It allows for the smooth interaction between two bones in a joint.
How does articular cartilage get injured? Damage can result in the articular cartilage as an isolated incident or occur due to another knee injury.</description>

      <description>Many people play sports in some way or another, whether they are playing for fun in their backyard or competitively on a team. Exercising by playing sports can be very beneficial to your health, but sometimes these benefits to your health are outweighed by negative things, such as an injury. The severity of these injuries can range from minor to very serious, with some injuries requiring surgery to fully heal. These injuries may be caused from poor training practices, improper equipment, flawed techniques, or may just be an accident.</description>
